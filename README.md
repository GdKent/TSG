# A Stochastic Gradient Method for Trilevel Optimization

This is the numerical implementation accompanying the paper "A Stochastic Gradient Method for Trilavel Optimization".

## 1. Software Requirements

The code was implemented in Python 3.9 and requires the following libraries:

- numpy
- torch
- torchvision
- sklearn
- scipy
- time
- random
- os
- pandas
- math
- tarfile
- matplotlib
- copy


## 2. Python Scripts

The .py files can be broken up into three categories: "solver", "driver", and "functions".

- "Solver" file: This file contains all of the code for the implementations of the trilevel algorithms.
- "Driver" file: This file contains all of the code for running the specific experiments to generate all of the plots that are displayed in the paper.
- "Functions" file: This file contains all the the code that defines the different types of problems that were tested.
